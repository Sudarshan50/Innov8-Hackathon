# INNOV8: The Space Saga

Welcome to **INNOV8: The Space Saga**, organized by **ARIES IITD** in collaboration with **Eightfold.ai**! This exciting competition tests your leadership and problem-solving skills through two unique challenges in space exploration.

---

## Problem Statement Overview

As the captain of an advanced space exploration fleet, your mission involves tackling two complex tasks:

### Part 1: Decoding and Classifying Alien Communications

Your crew has intercepted mysterious alien transmissions on the planet Xernia. Your task is to classify these messages based on attributes such as alien species, number of fingers, and the presence of a tail.

- **Input**: 
  - A dataset `data.csv` containing intercepted alien messages.
- **Output**: 
  - A `result.csv` file that predicts the alien species from a test set (`test.csv`).
- **Evaluation**: 
  - The accuracy of the predictions.
  - The approach and cleanliness of your solution (submit your solution in `solution.ipynb`).

### Part 2: Predicting Troop Betrayal in the War Against the Phrygians

Your task is to develop a decision-making system that predicts which soldiers in your army are most likely to betray your clan during an upcoming war. 

- **Objective**: 
  - Analyze various factors and design a system that flags soldiers most likely to defect.
  - Focus on hypothesis generation, factor identification, and decision-making system design.
- **Evaluation**: 
  - Clarity of thought process and hypotheses.
  - Creativity in feature selection and system scalability.

---

## Submission Guidelines

- **Part 1**: 
  - Submit your `result.csv` with species predictions based on `test.csv`.
  - Submit a well-documented Jupyter notebook (`solution.ipynb`) explaining your approach, code, and logic.
- **Part 2**: 
  - Submit a PDF report outlining your decision-making system for predicting betrayal. 
  - (Bonus: Include working code and a dataset for extra points, though it's optional).

---

## Requirements

Make sure to include the following in your submissions:

- For Part 1:
  - `solution.ipynb` with clear comments and markdown.
  - `result.csv` for your predictions.

- For Part 2:
  - A PDF report explaining your approach to betrayal prediction, hypothesis, and workflow.
  - (Optional) Code with instructions for implementation.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Part 1**:
  - Accuracy of your predictions.
  - Cleanliness and clarity of your code and explanations.
  
- **Part 2**:
  - Quality of hypotheses for betrayal prediction.
  - Effectiveness of your decision-making system.
  - Scalability and adaptability of the proposed system.
  - (Bonus) Integration of code and datasets.
